# PowerShell-Windows-Web-Proxy
Iâ€™m currently working for a company where I have to set up a web proxy to connect my laptop to the Internet. Because I'm a little bit lazy to enable/disable this every morning when i come in, or when i open my laptop at home, i created this tiny script to enable/disable/set and show the settings of my Web Proxy in Powershell
